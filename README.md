# Book-Finder

  An application to help you keep enjoying your inner bibliophile happy.

Problem:
  Have you ever gotten to the end of a book and realized it was also the end of the series? That can leave you feeling like you have just reached the end of a long romantic relationship. What do you do next? Is there another book planned by that author in that series? Is there another series by that author available? Is there a similar series in that genre available? We can help you with that.

User Story:
  As a user I would like to be able to find the next book in a series by my favorite author. If there is not another book in that series I would like to see more books by my favorite author or find a similar book in that genre. I also love reading a book before I watch a movie to make sure that I understand what is going on before I go to enjoy the book come to life, I would like to see if there are any movies coming out soon or planned to be released soon based on books written by my favorite author.

Developer story:
  As a developer I would like to develop an API that finds a series of books based on a given title. If a book in that series is not available I would like to provide the user with a selection of other books by the same author or of a similar genre.
  
  If the user is unable to find a book in that selection that they like I would like to provide them with a randomizer option in which they can press a button and be given a random title from a selected genre.
  
  As a developer I would like to provide the user with a selection of movies that have been recently released or are in development based on books written by their chosen author. If there are no movies based on books by that author I would like to show them movies from that genre of books.
